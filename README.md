This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models designed to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various health parameters. The model uses KNN, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision tree and logistic regression to classify the risk of stroke in patients, trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle.
Introduction
The Stroke Prediction Model aims to assist in early diagnosis and prevention by predicting the probability of a stroke based on patient data, such as age, hypertension, heart disease, etc. This model is intended for educational and research purposes.
Dataset
The model was trained on the impstroke.csv dataset, which includes features such as:
•	Age
•	Hypertension
•	Heart disease
•	Smoking status
•	BMI
•	Glucose levels
•	Gender
